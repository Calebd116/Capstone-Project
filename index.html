    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <P>A creative powerhouse specializing in Web Development, Motion Graphics, Video editing, Graphics design, and music
        production/sound editing. My journey began as a video editor, but inspiration led me to dive headfirst into the
        mesmerizing world of motion graphics. From 2D wizardry to 3D magic, I‚Äôve honed my skills using tools like Adobe
        After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, FL Studio, and even Blender.</P>
    <p>A Medical Doctor with a Twist üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Yes, I wear a white coat during the day! I'm a Doctor of Medicine. But when
        the sun sets, I unleash my artistic side. I take pride in my knowledge, eagerness to learn new things,
        consistently finding a way to broaden my skills and make use of them.</p>
